It's crucial to understand the unique ecosystem before brainstorming solutions. Nearly all USC students live within 2 miles of campus and get free rides, affordding effortless study sessions with friends. But with social distancing in effect, this is no longer possible. In addition, the USC Marshall School of Business has a competitive grading curve that paradoxically deters students from collaborating with classmates. <br><br><strong>I wanted to resuscitate collaborative interactions through instantly closing the gap between students who need help and tutors who know the ropes.</strong><br></div>

    <div class="text-clopy">Existing options and competitors for academic support fail to be viable because students only realize they need help right before the exam. So how can I change the experience of seeking help from being ineffective to fulfilling?<br><br>I researched habit-forming principles of behavioral psychology to <strong>design a way for students to get personalized help with their hardest classes – the moment they feel overwhelmed.</strong> The creation of a two-sided marketplace for peer-to-peer tutoring would empower students to efficiently learn, work, and achieve their goals.<br><br></div>

    <div class="text-clopy">I first sketched various possible features that could empower students. My initial hypothesis was that students couldn’t find tutors that matched their learning style and personality. My plan was to survey learning preferences during onboarding to develop an algorithm that shows students the right tutor for them.<br><br>I realized my initial designs were not going to work because it didn’t address the main struggles that most students faced – getting stuck on a confusing problem or missing a class. These needs are more frequent and pressing than compatibility between students and tutors. <strong>Prioritizing reliability over compatability also leads to a more viable and sustainable product.</strong></div>

    <div class="text-clopy">I tested my prototype by asking students to complete certain tasks within the app. After closely observing students interacting with the app, I enhanced the user flow and information architecture to optimize usability.<br><br>I created a system of components to design a cohesive visual identity. <strong>Understanding that users may be in a stressed and agitated state,</strong> I used soft elements and round forms to convey a reassuring and calming effect. The choice of green as the primary color was inspired by its association with nature and growth, and by stories of its use in hospitals to promote stress-relief and healing. I designed a set of custom illustrations and icons that represent streamlined learning. I also explored designing a dark mode because students often study through the night before exams.</div>

        <div class="featture-text">Students want to feel successful and get good grades. Tutors want to make both an impact and money.<br><br>To provide problem help on-demand in a convenient way for both parties, I drew inspiration from my DoorDash experience. Tutors can log on or off whenever they want. When a request is made, they have two minutes to confirm they can solve it. <strong>This system effectively develops new market segments; potential customers who didn't need a full hour lesson are more willing to get help,</strong> and tutors are motivated to compete by confirming in a timely manner and being available at the right time.<br>‍</div>

Collaborating with popular USC students leverages micro-influencers marketing to dismantle stigma, increase exchange value through social rewards, and reframe tutoring as &quot;something someone like me does.&quot; By alleviating the pain of frustrating concepts for students, opening Accel becomes a conditioned response that drives customer retention.<br>‍</div>
