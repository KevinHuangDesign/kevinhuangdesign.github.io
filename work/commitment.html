          <div class="paragraph-light cc-position-name">USC President Carol Folt reached out to my advanced design team to create a signage campaign for the upcoming Spring semester. In a time where thousands of students are begging for academic support, where access to mental health services are restricted, and tuition is raised in the midst of a pandemic, the administration’s response is to simply tell students to cheer up? Our team of 7 decided to put our belief in the potential for both design and USC to do and be good. <br><br>I spearheaded the web to create a daily wellness check in, redesign USC’s Commitment to Change initiative, and develop an official petition platform to amplify student voices.<br><br><a href="../images/deck.pdf" class="button-9 w-button" target="_blank"> Learn more about the project </a>

    <h1 class="heading-2">How I approached the problem</h1>
    <div class="text-clopy">When students are frustrated, they often use their phones to escape stressful feelings. Instead of just distracting them, what if the solution was as easy as going on your phone?<strong><em> What if you could just take a photo of what you're stuck on and someone comes to the rescue?</em></strong><br><br>
I believe it is crucial to understand the unique ecosystem before brainstorming solutions. Nearly all USC students live within 2 miles of campus and get free rides through Lyft, which affords the ability to constantly meet and study with friends. But with campus closed and social distancing in effect, this is no longer possible. In addition, the USC Marshall School of Business has implemented a competitive grading curve that paradoxically deters students from helping classmates. <br><br><strong>I wanted to resuscitate collaborative interactions through designing the first solution that instantaneously closes the gap between students who need help and tutors who know the ropes.</strong><br></div>
    <div class="div-block-10"></div>
    <h1 class="heading-2">Designing behavior</h1>
    <div class="text-clopy">Existing options and competitors for academic support fail to be viable because students procrastinate, only realizing they need help right before the exam. So how might I change the experience of seeking help from being ineffective to fulfilling? I researched habit-forming principles of behavioral psychology to inform the following decisions. <strong>I began to design a way for students to get personalized help with their hardest classes – the moment they feel overwhelmed.</strong> The creation of a two-sided marketplace for peer-to-peer tutoring would empower students to efficiently learn, work, and achieve their goals.<br><br></div>

    <div class="text-clopy">I first sketched possible features to explore on-demand solutions that could empower students. My initial hypothesis was that students couldn’t find tutors that matched their learning style and personality. My plan was to survey learning preferences during onboarding to develop an algorithm that shows students the right tutor for them.<br><br>I realized my initial designs were not going to work because it didn’t address the main struggles that most students faced – getting stuck on a confusing problem or missing a class. These needs are more frequent and pressing than compatibility between students and tutors. <strong>Prioritizing reliability over compatability also leads to a more viable and sustainable product.</strong></div>

    <div class="text-clopy">First designing at a low-fidelity, I tested my prototype by asking students to complete certain tasks within the app. Armed with insights on the design's usability through closely observing students interacting with the app, I tweaked the user flow and information architecture to optimize the Customer Effort Score.<br><br>Next I created a system of components to design a cohesive visual identity. <strong>Understanding that users may be in a stressed and agitated state, I intended to convey a reassuring and calming effect.</strong> To do this, I leveraged soft elements and round forms. The choice of green as the primary color was inspired by its association with nature and growth, and by stories of its use in hospitals to promote stress-relief and healing. I designed a set of custom illustrations and icons that represent learning and support the core idea of “accel”–erating your academic growth. I also explored designing a dark mode because students often study through the night before exams.</div>

        <div class="featture-text">Students want to feel successful and get good grades. Tutors want to make both an impact and money.<br><br>To provide problem help on-demand in a convenient way for both parties, I drew inspiration from my DoorDash experience. Tutors can log on or off whenever they want. When a request is made, they have two minutes to confirm they can solve it. <strong>This system effectively develops new market segments; potential customers who didn't need a full hour lesson are more willing to get help,</strong> and tutors are motivated to compete by confirming in a timely manner and being available at the right time.<br>‍</div>

        <div class="featture-text">Although most students just need prompt help with a problem, those who want more can easily see a tutor’s availability and schedule a private lesson. Tutor enjoy the flexibility of choosing when, where, and how much they earn.<br><br><strong><em>How might I design the best time picker for students to see availabilities and schedule a private lesson?</em></strong> Testing my designs with tutors, I learned most students schedule 1-hour lessons. I designed the time picker to help users efficiently browse dates and book a time that works for their schedule.</div>

Collaborating with popular USC students leverages micro-influencers to dismantle stigma, increase exchange value through social rewards, and reframe tutoring as &quot;something someone like me does.&quot; By alleviating the pain of frustrating concepts for students, opening Accel becomes a conditioned response that drives customer retention.<br>‍</div>
